Repo for Kaggle WiDS Datathon 2019

The network we trained got us a 51st place, just shy of top 50 by a small margin. 

Further extensions could include using ensemble models, more relevant data augmentation.

Network provided needs original dataset downloaded to run. Not meant to be reproduced. Will clean in future pushes
